career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      With the combination of my double bachelor dregrees in Computer Science and Philosophy I have acquired
      both a deep and a broad understading of technology and the use of technology.

      I like to think and refelct critically about the way we implement and use technology,
      and how it affects the humans involved - both directly and indirectly.
      At the same time I understand the issues and challenges of implementations and know the technical language and have practical experiences.
